  - <effect=Wobble>Welcome Newbie!!</effect> To help you get settled in and familiar
    with the place, we decided to make a little scavenger hunt for you!
  - Around the office there will be secret notes with partial codes, these codes
    can be used to open up the safe in this room. Inside the safe is your <b><color=#8FFF9E>Key
    Card Strip</b></color> you need to create your very own <b><color=#8FFF9E>Key
    Card!</b></color>
  - "Here is your first hint to find the first secret note\u2026 <br><i>I am used
    to preserve.<br>I am cold to the touch.<br>I am used to keep your lunch.<br>What
    am I?</i>"
  - <effect=Wobble>Good Luck!</effect>
