  itemQuickDescription: Rusty and feeling like it can break at any time. However
    does feel like it has atleast one use left in it.

    of neglect. The wooden handle, worn smooth with age, bears the marks of countless
    hours of labor. Despite its appearance, the shovel feels sturdy in your hands,
    hinting at its former reliability.
