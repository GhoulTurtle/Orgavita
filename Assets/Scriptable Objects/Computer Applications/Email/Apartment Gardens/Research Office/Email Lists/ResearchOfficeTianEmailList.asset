    Body: Tian we need you guys at the office to process our sample requests faster.
      The field team finally broke through the growth on the stairs to the second
      floor and found a whole new ecosystem, with organisms and materials not from
      earth. <br><br>Needless to say they are super excited to get this stuff to
      the lab. So if you can double time on the sample requests then it would make
      my job a whoooole lot easier. <br><br>Let me know if you run into any problems.<br><br>Gloria
      Husk, Outpost Supervisor.
