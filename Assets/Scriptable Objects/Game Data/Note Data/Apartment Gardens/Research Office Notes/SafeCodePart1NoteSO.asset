  - Nice job finding this secret note! The first 2 digits of the code is <color="red"><code=Code
    Data/Apartment Gardens/Research Office Codes/SafeCode, startchar=0, charcount=2></color>..
  - Here is your next clue to find the next secret note! <br><i>In a place where
    you visit a lot. <br>In a place where people consider it a private spot. <br>In
    a place behind where people throw away unwanted objects.</i> <br>We couldn't
    figure out a rhyme for this one sorry!
  - <effect=Wobble>Good Luck</effect>
